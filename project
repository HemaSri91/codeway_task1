    <p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of 
        predicting sleep quality (i.e., poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given 
        the physical activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, 
        we focused on predicting good or poor sleep efficiency as an 
        indicator of sleep quality.</p>
    <p>Some habits that can improve your sleep health: Be consistent. Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including on the weekends. Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature.</p>
